# LEGACY_SJ_PAT_2020_INFO_KIOSK
A repository for the files of my old highschool IT PAT (11th Grade). The goal was to make an information kiosk that would be utilised in malls in the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

#Usage
Once an account is selected, the kiosk menu that the end useer will see is revealed. It
shows off the different aspects of the mall, and each page with it's own purpose:

-Restaurants and Foodcourt is the "focus" of the project. Users must agree to the mall's
COVID-19 Regulation policy, and will then be able to see the menu of each restaurant. (There
is a non-functional serch tab which was meant to be scrapped, but it was never removed. Please ignore that tab.) They can make an order from any restaurant, and have their receipt printed so that they can pick it up with minimal contact.

-Healthcare/Clinic informs the user of the existence of the Mall's clinic, and displays a map showing how to get there from the kiosk.

-Electronics and Tech informs the user of the commputer equipment store. It can display a map showing how to get there from the kiosk, and it also features a raffle page to win an RTX 3090. If the user guesses the same code the computer is "thinking" pf, they win.

-Cinema's and Entertainment displays a "Come Again Soon" page, as they are not accessible, due to the height of the pandemic at the time.

-Supermarket and Stores, like the other tabs, gives the user info and displays a map directing them to the store. It also features an FAQ page, discussing everything COVID-19 regulated in the mall.

-Pets and animals does the two basic features mentioned before (displaying info and location on a map), and also allows users to book their pets in the mall's kennel service. There the animals can be cared and treated well enough with minimal human contact. People suffering from COID-19 would also not be able to look after their pets, hence this features existence.

-If the user logged in as an Administrator, they will gain access to the Admin Menu. This allows the Admin and General User passwords to be changed. The menus of all the restaurants can also be changed.
